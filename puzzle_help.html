    <h2>Basic Usage</h2>
    <p>
        The Twisty Puzzle Page presents its user with any one of several twisty puzzles which
        can be selected from a scrolling menu revealed when the mouse cursor nears the top of the page.
        Most of these are well-known puzzles; others may have been made up for fun.  Whatever the case,
        all puzzles are manipulated the same way using the mouse.  Left-click and drag to orient the puzzle.
        Hover over the puzzle until a desired sub-set of its faces are highlighted, then use the mouse
        wheel to rotate those faces.  If they don't rotate, then it's due to bandaging of the puzzle.
    </p>
    <p>
        Double-clicking anywhere on screen will scramble the puzzle with your confirmation.
    </p>
    <p>
        For puzzles that have a special kind of move, such as the Curvy-Copter, hold the Shift or Ctrl key
        down while rotating the mouse wheel to take advantage of these types of moves.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that some axes of a puzzle are used to rotate more than one layer of a puzzle.
        The hot-spot for the default layer should be clear.  A secondary or tertiary layer, however,
        can be rotated by hovering the mouse further away from the puzzle, but along the same axis.
        This takes a bit of patience to manage, but isn't too annoying in practice.  See the 4x4 Rubik's Cube
        for an example of what I'm talking about here.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the lower left-hand corner, you'll find a few read-outs and controls.  All puzzles can be textured.
        This makes the puzzle a harder challenge in most cases.  A mirror-reflection of the puzzle can be toggled.
        I'm not sure how helpful this really is, but it's there.  Full undo/redo is supported.  You can save and
        restore the state of any puzzle under a given name.
    </p>
    <h2>Advanced Usage</h2>
    <p>
        Also in the lower left-hand corner, you'll find a text-box where a sequence may be input, then executed.
        Execution happens in the context of the current orientation of the puzzle, if you are using relative axis-label
        identifiers, or independent of the current orientation, if you are using fixed axis-label identifiers.
    </p>
    <p>
        The relative axis-label identifiers are the capital letters "L", "R", "D", "U", "B" and "R" or any combination
        of these letters that makes sense up to a length of 3.  For example, "UR" and "RU" both refer to an upper-right edge,
        while "URF" and "FRU" both refer to the same upper-right-hand corner in the front face.  Notice that these
        all assume that the general shape of the puzzle is a cube.  As of this writing, no relative axis-label
        identifiers are support for non-cube-shaped puzzles.  So the use of these identifiers is limited to those cases.
    </p>
    <p>
        The fixed axis-label identifiers are all lower-case letters.  In the case that a puzzle has more axes than
        letters of the alphabet, the identifiers become "aa", "bb", "cc" and so on.  Notice a check-box is provided,
        allowing you to toggle the rendering of these labels.
    </p>
    <p>
        Executable sequences are strings of text of the form, for example, "a, a, b, a, a, b".  Here, the axis
        labeled "a" is rotated twice, then "b" once, and we repeat this once.  For convenience, such a sequence
        may be written more compactly as "2[2a,b]".  Square brackets are used to replicate the enclosing sub-sequence
        a given number of times.  Curly braces, on the other hand, can be used to replicate the individual members
        of the enclosing sub-sequence.  That is, "2{2a,b}" becomes "4a,2b".  Sub-sequences can be nested to any depth.  
    </p>
    <p>
        A single quote (or prime mark) can be used to invert any identifier or sub-sequence.
        For example, you might write "a',b" or equivalently "(b,a')'".  This also works on sub-sequences formed
        using square or curly brackets.
    </p>
    <p>
        The tilde character may be used syntactically in all the same places a single quote can.
        It's effect is to reverse the sub-sequence.  So "(a,b)~" may be written instead of "b,a".
    </p>
    <p>
        Since solving a puzzle often means finding several useful sequences, and then applying them
        many times in different contexts, this makes the fixed axis-labels of limited usefulness.  To resolve
        this problem, an ability to freeze the location of these labels has been implemented using yet another check-box.
        Once frozen, the axis-labels become dynamically assigned based upon how you're orienting the puzzle, and upon
        where you froze the labels.

    <h2>Known Issues</h2>
    <p>
        Here is a list of currently known bugs/issues with the software...
        <ul>
            <li>Undo/redo state is not yet saved along with the state of the puzzle.</li>
            <li>Some puzzles currently have incorrect border geometry.</li>
            <li>The sequence feature has some bugs and is currently only useful for puzzles of cube shape.</li>
            <li>Highlighted faces can distract you from the color scheme of the cube.  Perhaps only border colors should be used to highlight faces.</li>
            <li>Some puzzles requiring many colors do not have a diverse enough color scheme.  Consequently, some colors are too close together to be discerned easily.</li>
            <li>The mouse-driven interface can be a bit hard to use in some cases, such as when a back-facing part of the puzzle is accidentally rotated.  Perhaps only forward-facing parts should be selectable.</li>
            <li>Hot-spots for face selection are not all optimally tuned.  Consequently, it can be hard to know where to hover the mouse to highlight faces.</li>
            <li>Not all my favorite puzzles are supported, nor might the puzzle engine be robust-enough or general-purpose-enough to handle them all.  For example, only rotations are supported while some puzzles require general rigid-body motions.  Reflections would be interesting as this isn't physically possible.</li>
            <li>Not all puzzles can be sufficiently scrambled using the naive algorithm I have in place for that purpose.</li>
            <li>The approximate cutting of rounded puzzle faces means that after a rotation, edges of these faces may not line up so nicely next to others.</li>
        </ul>
